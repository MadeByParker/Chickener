# Chickener

## Why did the chicken cross the road? 

## Find out, with aggressive cars and simple arithmetic maths!

### Story: You're a mother chicken and your egg has typically somehow is on the other side of a busy motorway, and you must save it! But be carefully as there's cars all around on the roads, even Formula 1 cars, so you must save it without getting chickened or trying to figure out simple Maths as chicken's aren't the smartest animals! ðŸ˜€

### Aim: Grab the egg whilst dodging cars on the motorway, if you die, don't worry you get a second chance by answering 1 simple maths question to get back into the action! Myth says, chicken's don't only have 1 life, not quite the cat with 9 lives.
